# Crush Compatibility Checker
Introduction
The Crush Compatibility Checker is a fun program that allows users to input the full names of people they have a crush on and calculates their compatibility based on the number of "loves" in the combination of the two names.

How It Works
The program works in a straightforward manner:

Users input the full names of the two individuals they have a crush on.
The program calculates the number of "loves" in the combination of the two names.
Based on the calculated love score, it determines their compatibility.
Compatibility Levels
If the love_score is greater than 80, it prints: "You Are Compatible."
If the love_score is between 50 and 80, it prints: "You might be compatible."
If the love_score is below 50, it prints: "Hey.....! you guys are like coke and mentos."
Usage
To use the Crush Compatibility Checker, simply run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to input the names. The program will then display the compatibility result.

Installation
There's no need for any installation. You can run this program in any Python environment.
