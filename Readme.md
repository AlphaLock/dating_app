# Dating App
This program allows users to input the full names of people they crush on and calcultes to see if they are compatible.

It calculates the number of loves in the combination of the two names and determine thier compatibility as well.

This is how it works

if love_score > 80:
   print ("You Are Compatible")
elif love_score > 50:
   print("You might be compatible")
else:
   print ('Hey.....! you guys are like coke and mentos')
